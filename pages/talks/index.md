Occasionally I give a talk on something interesting. I'll leave my slides here for your perusal.

## Business Application Metrics
*31 October 2013*
I was lucky to have presented a 15 minute lightning talk on metrics 
at [Durban Digital Day](http://www.durbandigitalday.co.za).
I took the audience through why metrics are so important
and gave a quick overview of what's needed to collect
and visualise metrics in your company.

## Amazon developer Luke Venediger on all things JavaScript
*14 Feb 2012*
While I was a front-end developer working at Amazon I had an interview with
Hendrik Swanepoel about the state of JavaScript and what we can expect from
the future.
