Summary = A tribute to my late Grandfather, Harry Roberts
-->

<p>One of my proudest moments was watching my them 88-year old Grandad
walking my wife down the isle at our wedding. My wife's father had
passed away many years back, and my Grandad steppes in to do the honors.
I pondered how this quiet, strong man has been a role model for me throughout
my childhood. It was a gift for me to have him play such a prominent role
on the most important day of my life.</p>

<p>Oh, how I miss my Grandad. It's not so much what he would say, but how he was
that had such an impact on my life. He was brought up rooted in strong
traditions on manners, respect and values. This came out in a quiet
presence like an earthquake that whispers. As a kid my family and I would travel
up to visit my grandparents during the holidays and turn their house
upside down while driving them both mad. Looking back it must've been sheer
chaos with my poor mom running after us, refereeing fights and trying to
keep the peace. It was a tough job, but my grandparents loved having us there
and had a seemingly infinite reservoir of patience. I hope they know I'm grateful
for it, even though as a kid I just took it all for granted.</p>

<p>My Grandad died at the age of 92 a few years ago, and I didn't go to his funeral.
My wife and I spent most of the day at the airport after missing our flight twice
And only getting a late booking. If only I'd planned it better, I could've been
there to pay my last respects. I can't forgive myself for missing his funeral and
regret it every time it passes into my thoughts.</p>

<p>My Grampa was a war hero, having escaped an Italian concentration camp during the
Second World War. Him and his fellow escapee trekked through the Italian countryside
for three months, dodging the enemy while occasionally finding shelter and food
in rural villages. But all the while they were on the brink of certain death. He
didn't talk much about the war but read about it all the time. I came to realise that
it affected him deeply, and the memories of what he saw must've been fresh in
his mind until the day he died. I wondered if he read a lot about World War 2
in the hope that he'd make some sense of what he'd been through. A man makes a 
choice after going through something
as de-humanising as a concentration camp: will this break your very soul into a
gust of shards or will it be the bricks that build on the foundation of your character.
My grandad chose to show how you can rise from this and raise a family, build a home,
love and look after a woman, and eventually show a boy how to grow up to be a man.</p>

<p>So Grampa, I wish you could meet my son, because he is just like you. I wish that he
could grow up smelling your aftershave while sitting at your knee. I wish that he could
hear your awful jokes and ask you silly questions. I wish that he could go with you
for walks in the afternoon and even a beer with the boys at the M.O.T.H. As much as I
wish this, I know that your influence lives on in the things that you have taught
me without saying anything at all. I love you, Grampa.</p>
