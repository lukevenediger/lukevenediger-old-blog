<p>Looking back on my life before my son arrived made me realise how much
I squandered my time, and how I spent it like a limitless resource. My
wife will attest to how I'd moan about not having enough time,
but the truth is that I had no appreciation for it. Then came the best
thing my wife and I ever made - my little boy wonder - and suddenly I
had no control over how and when my time was allocated. I was thrust
into contention land and quickly started seeing time as a precious,
limited resource that I needed but could not control.</p>

<p>Fast-forward to present day and, paradoxically, I
have never felt more productive than I do now. I've made more contributions to 
the Open Source community post-baby than ever before. I'm having
a roaring time at work with my new team and together we're building
internal and external systems that are changing the way my company works.
Most importantly, I feel like I'm getting value from the time I'm
spending which makes it a very satisfying experience. I'd like to
share some of the things I learnt while making this transition.</p>

<h2>Instant Work Mode</h2>

<p>I no longer had the luxury of "settling into the right frame of mind" before getting
to a productive level. The longest period I would say is guaranteed is a 
15 minute window, leaving no time to ease in. Once the timer starts and the laptop
or iPad opens I had to sprint up to pace quickly otherwise I could lose that
opportunity. Instant work mode forced me to get focused quickly and push myself
to remember where I left off. Sometimes I'd leave a breadcrumb in the form of a
note with a few words on what I was working on in my last session.</p>

<h2>Always Leave Something Unfinished</h2>

<p>I found it frustrating to be staring at my laptop without a clue of what to work
on next, and it was only compounded by my awareness if how little time I had. I
picked up a great tip that writers use to ensure they're productive straight away:
Always leave a piece of work unfinished, so that you've got something to work on
as soon as you're at your computer. It doesn't matter how trivial the task is
so long as it jars your mind and get you into the zone quickly.</p>

<p>I found that keeping a .txt file in my project directory and making a note of
what my current thoughts were really helped. Something like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>System level metrics are available via the SystemMetricService
  Grab ISystemMetricService from the IOC container
  Currently: adding metrics to the statsd listener</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Keeping my last thoughts like this meant I could retain most of the mental models
I'd put in my head while working. Just a few words on what I was working on is
enough to restore my "working set", so to speak.</p>

<h2>Get Used to an 80% Completion Rate</h2>

<p>With time being such a precious commodity I couldn't afford to fuss about with spit
and polish. I always try reach for a working feature and avoid the rabbit hole
that happens between working and perfect. I build the feature with a minimum
viable acceptance factor and move on once that's satisfied. Taking this approach
has helped to frame what it is I'm working on and look for ways to simplify it further.</p>

<p>I've applied this approach within my team at work and combined it with an iterative,
short-release-cycle mentality. I find myself not as anxious to release an 80% solution 
because the next
release is around the corner. Also, a feature needs time to settle once it's out there
so that the real use-case can bubble up. Aiming for 80% is more about facing the reality
of how a feature matures, and isn't about compromising on quality or completeness.</p>

<h2>Invest in Streamlining Your Workflow</h2>

<p>Working on <em>how</em> I work is just as important as doing the work itself, otherwise I'll
be burning precious minutes on crufty processes instead of actual creative work.
I've built a few tools to help me streamline things to my liking such as 
<a href="https://github.com/lukevenediger/champ">champ</a> for static site generation. Having
knowledge of scripting languages like bash or powershell is the glue
between common tasks. I want the computer to work for me, not the other way around.</p>

<p>On a personal level I have a rudimentary note that I use to track some of my projects.
I can't decide if keeping such a list is worth the maintenance and overhead. I get
the feeling that we don't trust our own brains enough these days and should really be
putting them to work. I gave up taking notes in meetings at work about two years ago and
it was a huge stress relief. I've learnt to distil the message from the content when
in meetings in real time
as opposed to capturing the content for review at a later date (read:
never). So I'm still on the fence about tracking personal progress. Maybe a personal
Kanban board is the answer.</p>

<h2>Eat Properly and Exercise</h2>

<p>Without sounding too obvious, being a Dad is a hard-enough job on its own and the first
aspect of my life that lost in the contention war was my eating and exercise. 2014 is the
year for me to fix this and get my health back on track. But the cost to my body has been
great - learn from me and take care of your body.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading, and I'd love to hear your thoughts and productivity tips.</p>

<p>-Luke</p>
